# Jarvis – My AI Tech Support Assistant

## Overview
This project uses ElevenLabs to create a conversational AI voice assistant named Jarvis. The purpose is to learn the fundamentals of building a knowledge base, designing conversation branches, testing an AI voice agent, and providing accurate technical support for accounts, software, networks, and hardware.

## Types of Issues Jarvis Can Handle
- Account and login support
- Software and applications support (Microsoft 365, Zoom, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Network and Wi-Fi connectivity support
- Devices and hardware support (printers, peripherals, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)

## Discussion & Reflection

1. **Branch Design Challenge**
   - Most challenging part: Making each conversation branch distinct so the agent wouldn’t mix topics
   - Lessons learned: Clear instructions and separation of conversation flows are essential for accurate responses

2. **Knowledge Base Impact**
   - Impact: Short, factual, and well-organized knowledge base sections made Jarvis faster and more precise
   - Observations: Clean content improved accuracy and reduced confusion

3. **Real-World Application**
   - Applications:
     1. IT support desks – provide 24/7 technical assistance
     2. School or workplace help centers – reduce staff workload
     3. Remote troubleshooting – guide users through common tech issues
   - Ethical Consideration: Privacy must be respected when handling user accounts or sensitive device information

4. **Challenges & Observations**
   - Easiest issues to handle: Account and login problems, because the steps are clear and repeatable
   - Hardest issues to handle: Network and hardware problems, because multiple factors can affect outcomes
   - Behavior with unknown issues: Jarvis politely suggests contacting IT support if the problem is beyond its knowledge
