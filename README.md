Jarvis – My AI Tech Support Assistant

Overview
I built Jarvis, my personal AI tech assistant, using ElevenLabs. Jarvis helps users solve common technical problems with accounts, software, networks, and devices. The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a knowledge base, design conversation branches, and test a fully functional AI voice agent.

Knowledge & Workflow

Jarvis uses multiple conversation branches to handle different types of technical issues:
	•	Account and Login Support – Helps with login or account problems.
	•	Software and Applications Support – Helps with software installation, crashes, or updates.
	•	Network and Wi-Fi Support – Helps with Wi-Fi, internet, and router issues.
	•	Devices and Hardware Support – Helps with printers, peripherals, and other devices.

The workflow starts with a Qualification Agent, then routes to Technical Support, then to specific Subagents, and finally ends.

Discussion & Reflection

Branch Design Challenge
The hardest part was making each branch distinct so Jarvis would answer correctly without mixing topics. I learned that clear instructions and separating conversation paths are essential for accurate responses.

Knowledge Base Impact
Organizing the knowledge base into short, factual sections made Jarvis faster and more precise. Clean, well-structured content improved response accuracy and reduced confusion.

Real-World Application
Jarvis could be used in IT support desks, help centers, or schools to provide 24/7 tech help, reduce staff workload, and give users consistent guidance.

Challenges & Observations
	•	Easiest issues to handle: Login and account problems, because the steps are clear and repeatable.
	•	Hardest issues to handle: Network and hardware problems, because multiple factors can affect the outcome.
	•	Behavior with unknown issues: Jarvis politely suggests contacting IT support if it can’t solve the problem.
