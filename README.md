# Building Your Voice Agent – Conversational AI in Action

## Overview
This project uses ElevenLabs to create a conversational AI voice assistant named Jarvis. I built this project to learn how voice agents work without writing code by creating a knowledge base, designing conversation branches, and testing responses. Jarvis is designed to provide clear and professional technical support for common user issues.

## Types of Issues Jarvis Can Handle
- Account and login issues
- Software and application support (Microsoft 365, Zoom, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Network and Wi-Fi connectivity problems
- Device and hardware support (printers, peripherals, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android)

## Discussion & Reflection

1. **Branch Design Challenge**
- Most challenging part: Keeping each conversation branch separate so the agent did not mix different issue types
- What I learned: Voice agents require clear intent detection and structured conversation flows to work properly

2. **Knowledge Base Impact**
- Impact on responses: Short and factual knowledge base content improved response speed and accuracy
- Observations: Technical support documentation worked better than long articles

3. **Real-World Application**
- Applications:
  1. IT support desks providing 24/7 technical assistance
  2. School or workplace help centers handling common technical questions
  3. Remote troubleshooting for everyday technology issues
- Ethical consideration: User privacy must be respected when handling account or device information
